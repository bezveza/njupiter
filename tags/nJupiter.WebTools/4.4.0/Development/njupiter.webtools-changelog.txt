===============================================================================
Changes for V4.4.0.476 - 2012-08-20
===============================================================================

NEW: VirtualPathProvider for resource files added to nJupiter.Web.UI.Hosting

ENH: All web files are now embedded in the DLL instead of being local resources

===============================================================================
Changes for V4.3.1.474 - 2012-08-16
===============================================================================

ENH: Added configuration options for WebNavigation heading inner span and
     heading level.

===============================================================================
Changes for V4.3.0.362 - 2012-05-02
===============================================================================

NEW: Wrappers for some objects under System.Web.Security added so they can be
     used in unit tests.

NEW: And UnauthorizedStrategyFactory that will return implementations of
     IUnauthorizedStrategy added. One generic implementation added plus an
     implementation for Forms Authentication. These strategies can be used to
     force an login prompt in for example an MVP presenter.

ENH: UrlHander now implements an Interface and can be accessed via an instance.
     All static methods and properties are marked as obsolete.

ENH: nJupiter.Globalization now has it's own NuGet package and is no longer
     bundled with WebTools.

===============================================================================
Changes for V4.2.0.360 - 2012-04-27
===============================================================================

NEW: A HttpContextHandler added that contains a property named "Current" that
     will return the same instance of HttpContextBase over a http request.

ENH: Some old web controls set to obsolete.

===============================================================================
Changes for V4.1.0.350 - 2012-04-13
===============================================================================

NEW: ControlLoader is now added, that can load a web control that is not
     catchable just by its virtual path, but by a custom string.

ENH: The ControlHander is now split up into several different interfaces with
     belonging classes so they can be used together with IoC-containers and
     also be easily mocked away. The static methods on ControlHander is still
     there though so the component is still interface compatible.

BUG: WebNavigation now does not try to find removed nodes of the root page
     when IncludeRootLevelInList is true. Wrong behaviour before this fix can 
     be observed setting VisibleInMenu on the root page to false and setting
     IncludeNodesOfRemovedNodesMode to Always or OnlyInSelectedPath on the
     navigation control.

===============================================================================
Changes for V4.0.1.308 - 2011-12-14
===============================================================================

ENH: nJupiter is now on NuGet and after this release all projects will be
     splitted up in separate solutions to more easly handle separate releases
     of the packages. All components will be released in separate packages in
     the future so every project will get its own changelog.

===============================================================================
Changes for V4.0.0.0 - 2011-12-13
===============================================================================

CHG: Some legacy code moved from nJupiter.Drawing into this assembly to be able
     to remove nJupiter.Drawing completely.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.16.1.0  - 2011-02-24
===============================================================================

BUG: Backed out the patch for StreamImage.aspx in 3.16.0.0 because it was
     wrong.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.16.0.0  - 2011-01-27
===============================================================================

BUG: Fixed a bug in HtmlHandler and its AutoHyperlinkText and AutoHyperlinkHtml
     methods, where an email address containing two consecutive dots (..) was
     not recognized as an email address.
BUG: Fixed a bug in StreamImage.aspx where the path parameter was double url
     decoded, and therefore paths with + in them didn't work as they got
     decoded to a space on the second url decode.
ENH: Added the possibility to evaluate the HTML link in AutoHyperlinkText, and 
     thereby makes it possible to change the url or the text of the link and
     add custom attributes
ENH: Added the AutoHyperlinkHtml method, that does the same thing as 
     AutoHyperlinkText but ignores URLs within tags (<a href="[url]">) and URLs
     between the start and end tags for the anchor tag (<a>[url]</a>).
BUG: HtmlHandler.AutoHyperlinkText made an end parenthesis trailing the url 
     part of the url. This should not be included in the url unless the 
     character after the parenthesis is a character part of a normal url. If it
     is a space for instance we should end the url before the parenthesis.
ENH: In Paging, added the CurrentPageForceInnerSpan property to be able to 
     force an inner span on the control for the current page (anchor, 
     linkbutton or button) and the CurrentPageCssClass to be able to set a CSS 
     class on the HTML element of the current page. CurrentPageForceInnerSpan 
     is needed to render an HTML element for the current page in anchor and 
     linkbutton modes when InnerSpan is set to false because otherwise it
     would just be a text node there. CurrentPageCssClass will not be rendered
     in the anchor and linkbutton modes unless InnerSpan is set to true or 
     CurrentPageForceInnerSpan is set to true.
BUG: WebCheckBox did not render the attributes in the InputAttributes 
     collection.
BUG: WebCheckListControl did not clear the controlToRepeat.Attributes 
     collection on each rendering of a list item.
BUG: WebAnchor did not render Controls added to it runtime by the method 
     WebAnchor.Controls.Add.
BUG: WebButton's OnClickEvent was fired both in RaisePostBackDataChangedEvent
     and RaisePostBackEvent when using IE6 , thus the event handler was called
     twice. When using IE6, OnClickEvent is now only fired in 
     RaisePostBackDataChangedEvent.
     
===============================================================================
Changes for V3.15.1.0  - 2010-06-15
===============================================================================

BUG: Fixed a bug in WebNavigation that caused IncludeChildrenOfRemovedNodesMode
     to not be honoured when StartLevelFromRoot > 0.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.15.0.0  - 2010-05-05
===============================================================================

ENH: Add possibility to force going through StreamingPath in WebImage even 
     though we have not set MaxWidth or MaxHeight. This is done by setting the
     ForceStreaming property on WebImage to true.
BUG: Fixed a bug in HtmlControlAdapter that caused that the InnerSpan
     attribute was ignored on HtmlControls.
CHG: NavigationPageCollection in WebNavigation is now inheriting directly from
     List<INavigationPage> instead of SortableList<INavigationPage>
	 
===============================================================================
Changes for V3.14.0.0  - 2010-02-10
===============================================================================

BUG: Made InnerSpan of WebAnchor with NoLink=true write out the ID if RenderId 
     is true
BUG: Made InnerSpan of WebAnchor with NoLink=true write out attributes added
     to the WebAnchor
ENH: Implemented VisibleLevels in WebNavigation, returns the number of visible
     levels in the navigation tree

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.13.0.0  - 2009-09-30
===============================================================================

ENH: In the pageing control it is now possible to change the number of pages
     shown, it was hard coded to 5 before.
BUG: Made checklist controls care about the Enabled property of ListItem.
ENH: Made it possible to override the rendering of  the label in checklist 
     controls.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.11.0.0  - 2009-04-17
===============================================================================

BCH: Old legacy-ascx-files removed for Paging, GeneralListing and PagedListing

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.10.0.0  - 2009-03-18
===============================================================================

NEW: Several control adapters added
ENH: In PagedListing it is now possible to set paging controls externaly
CHG: Removed implementation for page validation from WebButton. It didn't work
     anyway since Microsoft has make it impossible to fully implement this in
     custom controls by closing down their own interface and make it private :(

===============================================================================	 
Changes for V3.9.0.0  - 2009-01-23
===============================================================================

BUG: Fixed a bug in UrlHandler, namely that no UrlHandler method took care of 
     the case where a URL contained fragment information, #.

===============================================================================

NEW: IndenterModule, experimental HTTP Module added, adds an http-filter to 
     all html requests that will indent all well formed XHTML. Use with care.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.7.0.0  - 2008-09-11
===============================================================================

NEW: New abstract base class for navigation controls calles
     nJupiter.Web.UI.Controls.WebNavigation, which makes it possible to make
     more generic navigations and to mix different implementations in the same
     navigation.
     A new delegate is added named CreateWebNavigationControl that returns the
     current implementation.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.5.0.0  - 2008-07-01
===============================================================================

BUG: Fixed bug i Paging where url got cut in browser due to incorrect encoding
     of the query string

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.4.0.0  - 2008-06-10
===============================================================================

NEW: New class WebScriptHolder makes it possible to place scripts outside head.
     If such an object exists on the page
     ControlHandler.RegisterClientScriptBlock places the script there,
     otherwise the WebHead, and lastly it resorts to ASP.NET default behaviour.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.3.0.0  - 2008-05-02
===============================================================================

NEW: New class HtmlHandler that can let you automatically hyperlink informal
     urls, strip all HTML tags from a string or convert line breaks to <br/>.

     actual Click event occurs.

     v1.0 sharp
 
=============================================================================== 
Changes for V3.2.0.0  - 2008-02-18
===============================================================================

BUG: Fixed bug in WebLinkButton where NoLink=true resulted in an unencoded
     string
ENH: Paging is now a templated control, so you can make HTML of your own choice
     now, or just use the builting defaults.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.1.0.0  - 2007-11-15
===============================================================================

ENH: WebGenericControl and all its inheritors does no longer render if they are
     completely empty.

     custom express install movies.
ENH: WebFlash has now support for SWFObject2 http://www.swffix.org/

     Normal method will probably be default render mode when out of alpha
     stage.

===============================================================================
Changes for V2.1.0.0  - 2007-05-18
===============================================================================
  
BUG: Bug fix in WebRadioButtonList concerning the name attribute. In .NET 2.0
     Microsoft does not add the UniqueId to the radiobutton name attribute.
     This is needed for WebRadioButtonList to work
ENH: Added WMode property on WebFlash. The Transparent property is now
     obsolete. It will still work as before, but please update your code.
ENH: TrailingBreak and TrailingLinefeed is now implemented in all relevant

===============================================================================
  
BCH: Changed name on property SuppressAutoDatabinding to
     SuppressAutoDataBinding
BUG: Bug fix for Paging component where "..." links were shown even though
     buttons were active
BUG: Bug fix in WebFlash.cs. It now inherits from WebGenericControl instead of
     HtmlGenericControl. This makes sure it renders a div tag.
BCH: GeneralListing and PagedListing are now pure webcontrols, please remove
     the reference to the ascx's in your project and refer to the namespace
     instead. The lists are no longer put to viewstate by default. If you need
     to have the datasource viewstated, then set ViewStateList to true. This is
     almost only needed when you have form controls inside your list.
ENH: Paging is now a pure webcontrol, please remove the reference to the ascx
     in your project and refer to the namespace instead.
ENH: PagedListing now automatically adjusts CurrentPageNumber to the highest
     possible page number given the total count if we get out of bound (by
     setting ItemsPerPage and pressing next and getting out of bound). This
     happens regardless of how DisablePaging is set.
ENH: WebFlash has now support for UFO which is default instead of SWF object.
BCH: ControlUtils are renamed to ControlHandler
BCH: IsWorthlessBrowser in ControlHandler is renamed to IsIE
NEW: A new property is added to detect PreIE7-browsers
NEW: A new class called WebHead has been added. Use this instead of the head
     element to be able to add scripts and styles to the head with the new
     function ControlHandler.RegisterClientScriptBlock
ENH: Paging has now full support for accessable linked paging (Use Links insted
     of Buttons)
NEW: A new more accessible WebLinkButton has been added
ENH: WebButton does no longer make use of scripts in IE7 or above (?. we hope
     it will never be any above)
CHG: WebDropDownList does now inherit directly from DropDownList in .NET2.0 and
     above
ENH: WebForm does now add application/xhtml+xml compliant comments to all
     script tags

= nJupiter.Text.SimpleTextParser =

A very simple text parser that currently contains implementations to format a text with a set of configurable regular exceptions. It is also very easy to extend with new formatters by implementing the IFormatter interface. The component currently has example configuration for converting BBCode to XHTML (look in [http://code.google.com/p/njupiter/source/browse/trunk/Development/Shared%20Resources/Config/nJupiter.Text.SimpleTextParser.config nJupiter.Text.SimpleTextParser.config]).

nJupiter.Configuration is a lightweight component for easy management of XML configuration files. It makes it easy to fast add different configurations for your assemblies and components. Automatically adds file watchers to local files so configuration can be updated without restarting the application. 

== History and Purpose ==

nJupiter.Configuration was the first component that was written for nJupiter, it was the written in the spring of 2005 with the aim to produce a lightweight component that would be able to easily add new configuration to .NET projects. Back then no good open source component for configuration were available and the System.Configuration namespace in .NET 1.1 was quiet limited.

The only relativly free alternative back then was the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648130.aspx Microsoft Configuration Application Block], which was a quite bloated component and also suffered from some realy important shortcomings. The XML files generated by this component was serialized hash tables which made the configuration files very inflexible and difficult to read and modify. The license was also not a desirable one, so [http://code.google.com/u/martin.odhelius/ I] decided to write my own component that would meet my aims, and the result was nJupiter.Configuration. The component is partly inspired by [http://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html log4net] and how that component handles its configuration.

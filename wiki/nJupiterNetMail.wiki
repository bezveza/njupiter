= nJupiter.Net.Mail =

Simple implementation of an SMTP client and Standard Arpa Internet Message defined in RFC822.

This component is really old and contains lot of not so clean code. It was mainly written for .NET 1.1 which lacked from a managed SMTP-client but was dependent on COM-objects.

Since this component isn't really supported and updated any longer it is suggested to use .NET:s own implementation instead of this one if you want an advanced SMTP functionality. This project is just still in the nJupiter-project to supply an open source implementation of a SMTP-client.

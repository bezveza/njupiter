Changes for upcoming version
===============================================================================
**** nJupiter.Web.UI
ENH: Added the possibility to evaluate the HTML link in AutoHyperlinkText, and 
     thereby makes it possible to change the url or the text of the link and
     add custom attributes
BUG: HtmlHandler.AutoHyperlinkText made an end parenthesis trailing the url 
     part of the url. This should not be included in the url unless the 
     character after the parenthesis is a character part of a normal url. If it 
     is a space for instance we should end the url before the parenthesis.

===============================================================================
Changes for V3.15.1.0  - 2010-06-15
===============================================================================
**** nJupiter.DataAccess.Ldap

NEW: New component containing a generic MembershipProvider and RoleProvider for
     LDAP (nJupiter.DataAccess.Ldap.LdapMembershipProvider and

     tested with Microsoft Active Directory, Novell eDirectory and
     IBM Lotus Domino / IBM Tivoli Directory Server.

**** nJupiter.DataAccess
BUG: When parsing search strings FullTextHandler incorrectly interpreted a 
     minus sign without a preceding space as a search operator. A minus sign
     is now interpreted as a search operator only if it is in the beginning of 
     the search string or preceded by a space and not inside quotes.

**** nJupiter.DataAccess
BUG: Fixed a bug that made the AddPostsToCollectionFromDataTables method crash 
     when trying to get nested sorted posts for a category. Now the customized
     view of the table (DataTable.DefaultView) is used instead of the table,
     because it's the in the customized view where the sorted collection is to
     be found.

**** nJupiter.Web.UI
ENH: Add possibility to force going through StreamingPath in WebImage even 
     though we have not set MaxWidth or MaxHeight. This is done by setting the
     ForceStreaming property on WebImage to true.

     attribute was ignored on HtmlControls.
CHG: NavigationPageCollection in WebNavigation is now inheriting directly from
     List<INavigationPage> instead of SortableList<INavigationPage>

**** nJupiter.Security

     that old values could be rewritten when a user was saved
BUG: HybridMembershipProvider could not save users to primary provider that had
     an non-Guid user identity 

**** nJupiter.Web.UI

     unlaod it before you send it back down to the main implementation.
  
**** nJupiter.Web.UI.CssCompressor
BUG: Fixed a bug related to invalid if-modified-since-dates sent by IE6

Changes for V3.12.0.0  - 2009-06-08
===============================================================================

**** nJupiter.Services.Forum
BCH: The interface in the ForumDao is slightly changed. Now you have to
     specify the mandatory fields already in the CreateCategoryInstance
     and CreatePostInstance methods instead of doing it when you save a
     category or a post.

**** nJupiter.DataAccess.Users
BCH: UsersDAOImplDS moved to an own assembly
     nJupiter.DataAccess.Users.DirectoryService.UsersDAO
     so nJupiter.DataAccess.Users no longer shall have any dependencies to
     nJupiter.DataAccess.DirectoryService
BCH: The Cache handeling make no longer use of inheritance, insted the cache
     handler is a composition object on the UsersDAO object so it is possibe
     to use other caching handlers than the generic one.
NEW: New cache handler added: HttpRuntimeUserCache which make use of the
     System.Web.Caching.HttpRuntime cache. Please take a look in the

     what root post a post has either through inheritance (not being a root post) 
     or being a root post.
ENH: Now possible to sort on the attribute values of posts and categories. This
     is done by setting the SortAttributeName property on the result configuration

**** nJupiter.Services.Forum.UI
CHG: nJupiter.Services.Forum.UI.config not mandatory anymore
ENH: FlatTabularPostList now has a RootPostTitle column which can be hyperlinked

     value.
ENH: FlatTabularPostList now exposes a PostsSorting event which can be used to
     intercept what is to be sorted and change it.
ENH: FlatTabularPostList can now be sorted by any property belonging to a post
     and not just the columns that are implemented in it. This was accomplished
     by removing the SortColumn property and exchanging it with the SortProperty
     property.
ENH: FlatTabularPostList can now be sorted by any attribute belonging to a post
     by setting the SortAttributeName property. If this property is set, it 
     always overrides any value set on the SortProperty property.
ENH: UpdatePost can now be set to ignore updates made concurrently. This is done
     by setting the IgnoreConcurrentUpdate property to true. The default is false.

Changes for V3.0.0.0  - 2007-09-13
===============================================================================

**** nJupiter.DataAccess.Users
ENH: Now it is also possible to do range searches with GreatherThan, 
     GreatherThanOrEqual, LessThan and LessThanOrEqual also for BoolProperty, 
     IntProperty and DateTimeProperty as the serialized form of those preserves order, 
     which was needed for this to work.
NEW: New property on AbstractProperty: SerializationPreservesOrder. Set to false 
     if an implementation does not preserve order in its serialized form.
BUG: Fixed a bug where we never searched in specific contexts
BCH: Took away the Context property on SearchCriteria, as it exists on 
     SearchCriteria.Property already.

**** nJupiter.Services.Forum
ENH: Sorting is now using a secondary sort, TimePosted, when the sort key is
     not unique. Makes sorting on for instance Visible more predictable
NEW: New method, GetNumberOfPosts, retrieves number of posts. Optionally one
     can specify a time interval and include or not include hidden posts in
	 the count.

**** nJupiter.Services.Forum.UI:
ENH: Now possible to put an "All" item in the NumberOfItemsSelector
ENH: Now possible to limit the length of title in FlatTabularPostList.
CHG: Now odd rows have the css class "odd" and even rows have the css class

Changes for V2.1.0.0  - 2007-05-18
===============================================================================
  
**** nJupiter.Services.Forum

     properties reflect what category a post has either through inheritance 
     (not being a thread) or being a thread which belongs to a category directly.
NEW: New Property on Post: ParentId. Indicates the parent post of the post in the 
     same way CategoryId indicates what category a root post belongs to.
ENH: SavePost and SaveCategory now throws exception if (1) the updated item has 
     been deleted and (2) if the item has been updated by someone else since the 
     item was retrieved

BUG: Bug fix of one overload of GetPost: it would crash if we didn't find a post

*** nJupiter.Services.Forum.UI:
ENH: HierarchicalPostList can now be configured to specify a custom target for
     where a post should be added. The choices are the current post, the root 
     or a specified post. This is done via the AddPostTargetLocation and
     AddPostTargetPostId properties. The choice is reflected in what is sent 
     in the event arguments of the AddPost event. AddPostEventArgs is typically 
     used when one configures an instance of AddPost.
ENH: HierarchicalPostList can now be configured to specify a custom source for
     the reply text. The choices are the current post, the root or a specified 
     post. This is done via the via the AddPostReplySourceLocation and
     AddPostReplySourcePostId properties. The choice is reflected in what is sent 
     in the event arguments of the AddPost event, more specifically in the 
     ReplySourcePostId property. AddPostEventArgs is typically used when one 
     configures an instance of AddPost.
BCH: AddPost now has a ReplySourcePostId property. The UseTitleFromParentPost has
     been renamed to UseTitleFromReplySource.
ENH: Now possible to implement a custom TextFormatter, which makes it possible
     to write own routines for how the forum output is rendered, for instance to
     allow HTML or to convert textual smileys to graphical smileys. The standard
     implementation encodes input as HTML, converts newlines to <br/> and 
     automatically hyperlinks what looks like urls.
ENH: AddPost and UpdatePost now both have a mandatory fields "legend"
ENH: AddPost and UpdatePost now can present Author textbox after the Title and 
     Body textboxes
ENH: FlatTabularPostList now has a CategoryName column which can be hyperlinked
     through the UrlWithoutTrailingCategoryId property.

     _with_ the children in HierarchicalPostList
ENH: Now possible to hide the column headers in FlatTabularPostList
ENH: UpdatePost now handles concurrent updates and deletes
ENH: New AuthorResolver property on HierarchicalPostList and FlatTabularPostList
     makes it possible for the Author text to come from another source, for 
     instance UsersDAO.
BUG: Bug fix of HierarchicalPostList: send an empty object array if GetPost
     returns null (fixes so that the list becomes empty after deletion of the 
     root post)
ENH: Now possible to filter on dates in HierarchicalPostList
ENH: Now possible to include the body from the reply source in AddPost via the 
     UseBodyFromReplySource property. Implementing the PostQuoter interface and 
     setting the PostQuoter property on AddPost makes it possible to handle 
    quoting of posts in a customized way.
  
**** nJupiter.Web.UI
BUG: Bug fix in WebRadioButtonList concerning the name attribute. In .NET 2.0
     Microsoft does not add the UniqueId to the radiobutton name attribute.
     This is needed for WebRadioButtonList to work
ENH: Added WMode property on WebFlash. The Transparent property is now obsolete.
     It will still work as before, but please update your code.
ENH: TrailingBreak and TrailingLinefeed is now implemented in all relevant
     controls.
  
**** nJupiter.DataAccess
ENH: Now FullTextHandler.GetContainsSearchCondition takes an ImplicitOperator 
     parameter. The default is "And". Possible values are "And" and "Or".
BUG: Bug fix of FullTextHandler.GetContainsSearchCondition not recognizing 
     upper case OR, NOT and NEAR.

ENH: DeleteCategory now return a bool signalling if a category was affected
ENH: DeleteCategories now return number of affected categories
BCH: GetCategory now takes a CategoryResultConfiguration, as it didn't make sense 
     to give it a CategoriesResultConfiguration
CHG: Fulltext is now Neutral by default, not US English.
ENH: Comparison now has inequality operators, before it was only equal and notequal
ENH: ForumSqlDao implementation: In .NET 1.1 every date sent in to API methods is 
     assumed to be a UTC date. In 2.0 a date with the kind Unspecified is assumed 
     to be a UTC date. A date with the kind Local is converted to a UTC date before 
     being sent to the database. For DateTimeAttributes the logic is up to the 
     consumer.
NEW: New property on Category: Domain
NEW: New property on Post: EffectivelyVisible. Tells if the post is visible from the
     perspective of what filter you have used when you retrieved posts. 
ENH: Setting the date filter properties in ThreadedPostsResultConfiguration now 
     actually does something in the GetPost method, namely filters the first level
     of descendant posts
ENH: Now possible to page on the first level of child posts through the GetPost 
     overload that takes a PagingResultConfiguration
BUG: A bug with how the update and delete triggers handled updates of several rows
     has been fixed. The bug cause the PostCountVisible and PostCountAll in the table
     FORUM_PostDerivedInformation to contain wrong values.

**** nJupiter.Services.Forum.UI:
ENH: AddPost now supports reply indicators when using the UseTitleFromParentPost

     FlatTabularPostList
ENH: Now possible to filter on user identity via UserIdentity property in 
     FlatTabularPostList
ENH: UpdatePost now includes all fields that AddPost contains
ENH: AddPost, UpdatePost: now possible to hide Title field (makes Body 
     unconditionally mandatory)
ENH: HierarchicalPostList now takes virtually no viewstate at all when no buttons
     are visible on the control
ENH: FlatTabularPostList now automatically adjusts when the paging gets out of bound.
     This happens when a combination of setting NumberOfItems and pressing a paging 
     button makes us come outside the TotalNumberOfItems of the list. This is done 
     by looping until we have items or we are at page one. Rests on the logic in
     PagedListing that adjusts CurrentPageNumber on out of bound situations.
ENH: HierarchicalPostList can now be sorted in descending chronological order
ENH: FlatTabularPostList and HierarchicalPostList now provides possibility to
     hyperlink the authors' names via the UrlWithoutTrailingUserIdentity property.
ENH: Now possible to filter out levels in HierarchicalPostList, via Levels property.
     For instance blog pages might want to display the first level of posts.
ENH: Now possible to set maximum length on Author and Title in AddPost and 
     UpdatePost
CHG: All -ing events can now be cancelled, by setting the Cancel property on the 
     eventargs to true.

     are deleted automatically). Applies for USER_Context also.
CHG: Fulltext is now Neutral by default, not US English.
BCH: Breaking change for the SearchCriteria object. It now exposes a Property
     instead of Name and Value. Now it is also possible to do range searches
     with GreatherThan, GreatherThanOrEqual, LessThan and LessThanOrEqual.
     Does not work with Int, DateTime, Binary and Decimal until the serialized
     form of those preserves order, which is not implemented as of now.

**** nJupiter.Configuration
CHG: ConfigKey in ConfigHandler.GetConfig is no longer case sensitive
ENH: Has now support for relative paths in config. See the ReadMe.txt in the
     install folder for example how to use.

**** nJupiter.Net.Mail
BCH: The config for userName and password used in nJupiter.Net.Mail.MailSender
     has been changed. The userName and password are now attributes on the
     smtpServer-key instead of own elements.

**** nJupiter.Web.UI
BUG: Bug fix for Paging component where "..." links were shown even though buttons
     were active
BUG: Bug fix in WebFlash.cs. It now inherits from WebGenericControl instead of
     HtmlGenericControl. This makes sure it renders a div tag.
BCH: GeneralListing and PagedListing are now pure webcontrols, please remove the
     reference to the ascx's in your project and refer to the namespace instead.
     The lists are no longer put to viewstate by default. If you need to have the
     datasource viewstated, then set ViewStateList to true. This is almost only
     needed when you have form controls inside your list.
ENH: Paging is now a pure webcontrol, please remove the reference to the ascx
     in your project and refer to the namespace instead.
ENH: PagedListing now automatically adjusts CurrentPageNumber to the highest possible
     page number given the total count if we get out of bound (by setting ItemsPerPage
     and pressing next and getting out of bound). This happens regardless of how 
     DisablePaging is set.
ENH: WebFlash has now support for UFO which is default instead of SWF object.
BCH: ControlUtils are renamed to ControlHandler
BCH: IsWorthlessBrowser in ControlHandler is renamed to IsIE
NEW: A new property is added to detect PreIE7-browsers

     to be able to add scripts and styles to the head with the new function
     ControlHandler.RegisterClientScriptBlock
ENH: Paging has now full support for accessable linked paging (Use Links insted of
